# liber-imporium
First individual project (specialist book store) created using CSS / HTML and Bootstrap.

## Reason for starting this project
I have chosen this project because when narrowing down what I would like to work on, I decided to focus on a website that I would be passionate about and as I have always had a passion for books and reading, it was only natural that I wanted to challenge myself by creating a book-store website with multiple pages and aspects. Ensuring that the website would be attractive and appealing to the user while ensuring the key business goal was met, was my main objective and focus.
